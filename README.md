#### GPT Language Model Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a GPT Language Model from scratch. The model is a large language model (LLM) designed to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. It has been built with a deep understanding of Transformer architecture and language modeling techniques.

## Features
- Transformer Architecture: The model is built using the Transformer architecture, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in text.
- Text Generation: Capable of generating human-like text that maintains coherence across multiple sentences.
- Customizable: The implementation allows for customization of model parameters such as the number of layers, attention heads, and hidden units.

## Model Details
- Architecture: Transformer-based with multi-head self-attention.
- Training Data: Trained on the openwebtext.
- Language Modeling: The model is trained using the causal language modeling objective, predicting the next word in a sequence given the previous words.

## Documentation
- Extensive documentation has been provided within the source code to help understand the implementation details. Key areas of focus include:

## Model Architecture: 
Detailed comments explaining each component of the Transformer architecture, including the self-attention mechanism, positional encoding, and feed-forward networks.

## Training Process: 
Clear documentation of the training loop, loss function (cross-entropy loss), and optimization process (using Adam optimizer).

## Text Generation: 
Explanation of how the model generates text autoregressively, one token at a time.

## Future Enhancements
Fine-Tuning: Implementing fine-tuning on specific datasets to specialize the model for particular tasks or domains.

## Scaling Up: 
Experimenting with larger models and datasets to improve performance.

## Deployment: 
Creating a web interface to interact with the model in real-time.
